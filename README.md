# Eco-System-Simulation
High school project that simulates the food chain. 


The program creates a grid of wolves, sheep and plants based on user input. It then lets the organisms interact with each other while
keeping track of the population. Animals can reproduce, eat (sheep or plants), and move towards the said food. The simulation ends once
once any species is extinct.
